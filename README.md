# mrosata Shell Collection

#### Welcome to my shell collection
So there isn't anything crazy here at the moment. Just a script that I use to quickly access different ssh connections. The copy up on git is just a template of coarse I wouldn't put my creds up on git. (Well, you never know do you?). The other script here is for installing httpd quickly on an AWS Linux box and adding the ec2-user to the www group.

In the future I think I'll add other peoples scripts that I collect along my travels as well as my own. I'll have to make some folders. The collection will grow very slowley because I'm not trying to junk up the repo. I want to have a small toolbox that I can just take down when I need them on various machines.
